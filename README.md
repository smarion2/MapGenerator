Procedural generation of maps for rpg sessions.

This program is designed to make procedural maps to be used for RPG gaming sessions. For now you can generate a map and not really do anyting with it. Not too exciting yet but stay tuned!

Birth Chance is the chance a square is "alive" at first generation
Birth Limit is the amount of neighbors each square has if over the limit the square dies.
Death Limit is the amount of neighbors each square that are "dead" if over the limit the square will come to life if already dead.
